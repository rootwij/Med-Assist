**Recent Hospitalization (Community-Acquired Pneumonia)**:  
- Presented with right lower lobe crackles. Treated with ceftriaxone 1 g IV daily and azithromycin 500 mg PO daily. Chest X-ray performed (results not detailed); asthma remained stable during admission. Discharged with plans for pulmonology follow-up.
