Patient_2 is a retired engineer with a complex medical history, including epilepsy, Moyamoya disease, and tracheal pathology. Diagnosed with new-onset generalized epilepsy in early adulthood, he is managed with levetiracetam 250 mg BID (to be titrated) and received seizure safety education. Subsequently, he developed Moyamoya disease, complicated by an acute ischemic event and cognitive dysfunction. EEG and MRI are planned to evaluate disease progression and seizure etiology.  

Following this, he developed severe subglottic tracheal stenosis and tracheomalacia, requiring neck exploration, tracheostomy, bronchoscopy, tracheal stent removal, dilation, and Shiley tracheostomy tube placement. Post-procedural findings included stent-related granulation and inflammation. Concurrently, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is suspected, with polysomnography ordered and a tracheostomy-compatible CPAP trial pending results.  

Cardiovascular comorbidities include aortic valve stenosis, mitral regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, patent foramen ovale, and hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function, necessitating ongoing surveillance.  

Social history: Nonsmoker, rare alcohol use, married, retired. No known allergies. Family history is unremarkable.  

Management priorities:  
1. **Neurology**: Titrate levetiracetam, monitor seizure frequency, and reassess in 4 weeks.  
2. **Respiratory**: Optimize tracheostomy care, pursue OSA management, and counsel on weight maintenance to reduce airway strain.  
3. **Cardiovascular**: Monitor valvular function and pulmonary hypertension.  

Multidisciplinary coordination is critical to address seizure control, airway stability, and cardiopulmonary risk mitigation.
